/**
  Here you can define your i18n (internationalization) configuration.
  Currently, it is using the dead-simple configuration (no async pulling).
  If you determine that async fetch would be better, please feel free to
  update.

  To test another language, set lng to its key (ie; fr)

  In order to access these values, you need to include HoC into your components.
  Take a look at the counter for an example.
